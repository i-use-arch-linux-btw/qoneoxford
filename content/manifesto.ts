  slogan: `#OneOxford starts as a question - then we build it together. I'm David Quan 权丁文, standing for President (Postgraduate) with Zagham Farhan (Undergraduate) and Henry Morris (Welfare). With them, I'm fighting for independent misconduct investigations, student food support, and hardship transparency. I'll also champion an Oxford University Ball for all, AI literacy, mobilise alumni for careers, and DPhil continuation charge equity. One conversation, One coffee, and One community at a time.

        title: "Mateship",
        body: `My family's experience of what us Aussies call 'mateship' shapes how I want to serve. When my late mother battled brain cancer, our community carried us - meals, rides, kindness. I was ten when strangers became family through generosity. To pay that support forward, I've volunteered since 2013 as a U10-U16s basketball coach and designed youth social entrepreneurship programs.`,

        title: "Firewood",
        body: `My late grandfather, a pioneer of private non-profit education, believed that young people are like 'water at 70 degrees'. With a little more firewood, they can 'boil' and flourish. He provided education for tens of thousands of disadvantaged children. In my 2022 Open Letter "Dear Granddad", I reflected on what mattered to him: simple acts of remembering names, writing handwritten cards, listening. Inspired, through my "Coffee's On Me" podcast community, I've shared heartfelt conversations with students across Oxbridge - researching, asking, listening – while organising socials to connect people.`,

        body: `Delivery demands dedication. My podcast community reached 25,000+ listeners across 100+ conversations, available publicly, without institutional funding. I contributed to an Oxbridge college alumni campaign, raising £145,000 with record 92% pledge fulfilment, and co-created the Oxbridge AI Challenge. At Goldman Sachs, I was selected onto the Analyst & Associate Council. I studied Education across Cambridge and Oxford.`,

        title: "Stewardship",
        body: `My late mother, grandfather, and community across 3 continents teach me that we are stewards of resources. What matters is building collaborative systems where 'water at 70 degrees' always finds its firewood, regardless of who controls the match.`,

  visionTitle: "What does #OneOxford mean to you?",

  vision: `What if we have only #OneOxford, precious, worth fighting for? What if we had One standard of support and transparency, regardless of background, college, or department? What if even One student matters? What about #OneOxbridge, doubling our access and networks by bridging universities? What if #OneOxford meant not just postgraduates and undergraduates, but also alumni, staff, and locals?`,

  suAsHub: `Personally, #OneOxford starts as a question, before we build towards that reality together. I learnt that students need an SU that helps them navigate Oxford: what support exists, what's happening, where to go? My #OneOxford SU, collaborating with Zagham Farhan (Undergraduate) and Henry Morris (Welfare), will be the hub students actually turn to:`,

  practicalSupport: {
    title: "Practical support",
    body: `Students need practical support. Postgraduate continuation charge equity across Divisions. Transparent access to hardship funds. Centralized room and event platforms. A live library tracker to monitor capacity. A food bank for those in need.`,
  },

  misconduct: {
    title: "Trustworthy processes",
    body: `When students face misconduct, they need trustworthy processes. We will advocate for independent, holistic investigations.`,
  },

  connectivity: {
    title: "Connectivity",
    body: `Students need connectivity. Genuine JCR/MCR engagements. Cultural events beyond Freshers' Fair. Financial (and non-financial) support for societies and extra-curriculars. An iconic Oxford University Ball: One celebration, postgraduates and undergraduates together, #OneOxford!`,
  },

  aiAndCareers: {
    title: "AI literacy and careers",
    body: `Students need AI literacy amid digital transformations, not blind acceptance, not fear, but genuine understanding. As labour markets evolve, careers support must keep pace. Oxford's alumni network is largely untapped; the SU will connect students for careers, mentorship, and mobilise alumni support for initiatives. We are #OneOxford!`,
