  vision: `What if we have only #OneOxford, precious, worth fighting for? What if we had One standard of support, regardless of background, college, or department? What if even One student could shape policies? What about #OneOxbridge, doubling our access and networks by bridging universities? What if #OneOxford meant not just postgraduates and undergraduates, but also alumni, staff, and locals?`,

  suAsHub: `I learnt that students need an SU that helps them navigate Oxford - what support exists, what's happening, where to go. The #OneOxford SU will be the hub students actually turn to:`,

  practicalSupport: {
    title: "Practical support",
    body: "A live library tracker to monitor capacity. Transparent access to hardship funds with dignity. Centralized room and event platforms. A food bank for those in need.",
  },

  misconduct: {
    title: "When students face misconduct",
    body: "Students need trustworthy processes. We will advocate for independent, holistic investigations.",
  },

  connectivity: {
    title: "Connectivity",
    body: "Genuine JCR/MCR engagements. Authentic cultural events beyond Freshers' Fair. Financial and non-financial support for societies and extra-curriculars. An iconic Oxford University Ball: one celebration, postgraduates and undergraduates together, #OneOxford!",
  },

  aiAndCareers: {
    title: "AI literacy and careers",
    body: "Students need AI literacy amid digital transformation, not blind acceptance, not fear, but genuine understanding. As labour markets evolve, careers support must keep pace. Oxford's alumni network is largely untapped; the SU will connect students for careers, mentorship, and mobilise alumni support for initiatives. We are #OneOxford!",
  },

  delivery: `Delivery takes dedication and teamwork. My podcast community reached 20,000+ listeners across 100+ conversations, available publicly, without institutional funding. I contributed to an Oxbridge college alumni campaign raising £145,000 with 92% pledge fulfilment and co-created the Oxbridge AI Challenge. At Goldman Sachs, I was selected onto the Analyst & Associate Council. I studied Education across Cambridge and Oxford.`,
