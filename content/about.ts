  intro: `What does #OneOxford mean to you? What if we have only #OneOxford, precious, worth fighting for? What if we had One standard of support, regardless of background, college, or department? What if even One student could shape policies? What about #OneOxbridge, doubling our access and networks by bridging universities? What if #OneOxford meant not just postgraduates and undergraduates, but also alumni, staff, and locals?`,

  personal: `Personally, #OneOxford starts as a question, before we build towards that reality together.

My family's experience of what us Aussies call 'mateship' shapes how I want to serve. When my late mother battled brain cancer, our community carried us - meals, rides, kindness. I was ten when strangers became family through generosity. To pay that support forward, I've volunteered for over a decade as a U10-U16s basketball coach and designed youth social entrepreneurship programs.

My late grandfather, a courageous pioneer of private non-profit education, believed that young people are like water at 70 degrees; with a little more firewood, they can 'boil' and flourish. He dedicated his life to tens of thousands who had nowhere else to study. In my 2022 Open Letter "Dear Granddad", I reflected on what mattered to him: simple acts of remembering names, writing handwritten cards, listening. Inspired, through my 'Coffee's On Me' podcast community, I've spent years sharing heartfelt conversations with students across Oxbridge - researching, asking, listening – while organising socials to connect people.`,

  closing: `My late mother and grandfather taught me that progress transcends any individual; we are stewards of resources. What matters is building collaborative systems where 'water at 70 degrees' always finds its firewood, regardless of who controls the match.

Join our OneOxford.uk movement - one conversation, coffee, commitment, and community at a time!`,
